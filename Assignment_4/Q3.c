// to read from file use read()
//read(buff is where temporary stored when reading,how many bytes read)
//buff is void because agar int type kiya then file se read kiya hoa data should be only of type int
//void pointer can be typecasted to any type of memory address isliye used 
//fd is int value to uniquely identify a file
//fd file dicriptor i.e jisse file open kiya hai...on opening a file ek int is returned
//kitne bytes read and write voh return karega -1 on error
//close karna is imp to store nicely what we write in file
